# tec-Sonic

### Lore
The History of the Sonic Screwdriver in Doctor Who was introduced in 1968 in the story Fury from the Deep, and used twice more (The Dominators and The War Games) during the Second Doctor's tenure. It became a popular tool for the Third Doctor and Fourth Doctor onward. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_screwdriver

These are more specific functions of the sonic screwdriver:
- Force field wave to repel a Dalek.
- Unlocking or locking a door
- Burning or cutting certain substances
- Remotely detonating specific machines or explosives
- Amplifying sound-waves and the power of an X-ray machine beyond its normal capacities
- Disarming weapons and electronics
- Flashlight
- Intercepting and conducting teleportation
- Hacking an ATM
- Regenerating barbed wire on a fence
- Darkening eyeglass lenses to transform them into sunglasses
- Microphone (when connected to an audio amplifier)
- Detecting and interpreting signals
- Conducting medical scans
- Fixing
- Locking the coordinates of the TARDIS
- Tracking alien life
- Using red setting or dampers
- Controlling the properties of atoms and molecules on a small scale
- Operating computers, whether their origin is alien or human
- Providing geolocation
- Lighting candles
- Creating a force field wave with two (or possibly more) other sonics to physically repel a Dalek (it may have to be the same sonic device at different points in its own time stream)
- Modifying a mobile phone
- Disclosing and deactivating camouflage
- Disarming robotics
- Scanning and classifying matter
- Shattering glass
- Creating an "acoustic corridor" for speaking with someone far away
- Shocking neural centers of living organisms
- Downloading a person's consciousness and transfer it into a computer hard drive (only seen in a special model created by The Doctor as a gift to River Song)
- Triggering particular protocols of the TARDIS
- Tightening and loosening screws




### project
TEC-1 used to test, measure and set-up sonic devices to do some of the following..later the tec1 can be disconnected.

1. sonic screwdriver, for rotation
2. sonic transducer, for sending and receiving signals
3. sonic welder, to sonic join plastics metals etc
4. sonic drill, to remove small amounts material ahead of the tip
5. sonic deterrent, 
6. sonic atomic levitation
7. sonic harmonic scattering
8. sonic sonoluminescence, induce the release of light
9. sonic cleaning, 
10. sonic dispersion, mixing things 


### sonic screwdriver, for rotation

How do you do sonic rotation of an object? we need to focus multipe beam of ultrasound near and around the object to create a torque on the object to causes it to rotate. the phas of the waves have to spread appart.
